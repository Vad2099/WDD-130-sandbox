            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>"In the picturesque town of Valle de Bravo, nestled in the heart of the State of Mexico, our journey began. 
                It was the year 1990 when a group of nature enthusiasts and extreme sports lovers came together with a shared 
                vision. Inspired by the breathtaking landscapes and the thrill of the great outdoors, they decided to form our club.                    
                From the very beginning, our mission has been to provide unforgettable adventures in the midst of nature's wonders. 
                Over the years, we've grown and evolved, but our passion for outdoor exploration and our commitment to safety and 
                environmental stewardship have remained unwavering.                    
                Today, we are proud to continue our legacy as a leading provider of river and mountain adventures, offering our clients 
                the opportunity to experience the beauty and excitement that Valle de Bravo and its surrounding areas have to offer. 
                Our story is one of adventure, camaraderie, and a deep appreciation for the natural world, and we look forward to sharing it with you."
